** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 
* Uses of 2D and 3D sketching and digital tools

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Engineering drawing and artistic types of drawing, and either may be called simply "drawing" when the context is implicit. Engineering drawing shares some traits with artistic drawing in that both create pictures. But whereas the purpose of artistic drawing is to convey emotion or artistic sensitivity in some way (subjective impressions), the purpose of engineering drawing is to convey information (objective facts).

4.1a Demonstrate an understanding of how to use annotated sketching and digital tools to graphically communicate ideas and sketch modelling to explore possible improvements, in terms of physical requirements, such as:

*i.* function, usability, construction, movement, stability, composition, strength. 

*ii.* aesthetic qualities

*iii* manufacturing processes

*iv* suitability of materials and components.	

4.1b Demonstrate an understanding of methods used to represent systems and components to inform third parties, such as:

*i.* constructional diagrams/working drawings

*ii.* digital visualisations

*iii* circuit and system diagrams

*iv* flowcharts with associated symbols

*v* prototypes and models.

* Industry professionals use digital design tools to support and communicate the exploration, innovation and development of design ideas?

#+BEGIN_VERSE
There are three different scales of production: one-off, batch and mass/continuous flow. Products will be engineered differently depending on how the product is to be made. 

4.2a Awareness of different strategies, techniques and approaches to explore, create and evaluate design ideas, including:

*i.* Visual presentation, rendering and photo-quality imaging.

 

*ii.* Product simulation and systems simulation.


*iii.* Scientific analysis of real-world physical factors to determine whether a product will break or work the way it was intended.

4.3a. Awareness of different strategies, techniques and approaches to explore, create and evaluate design ideas, including:

*i.* Iterative designing.

*ii.* User-centred design.

*iii.* Circular economy.

*iv* Systems thinking.


4.3b. The importance of collaboration to gain specialist knowledge from across subject areas when delivering solutions in the design and manufacturing industries.

4.3c. Understand how design engineers use system design processe sto define and develop systems that satisfy specified requirements of users using the three sub-tasks of:

*i* User-interface design.

*ii* Data design.

*iii* Process design.
