** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 
* Factors that influence the selection of materials that are used in engineered products

Understand that the selection of materials and components is influenced by a range of factors, including:

*i.* functional performance.
 
*ii.* aesthetics.

*iii.* cost and availability.

*iv.* properties and characteristics.

*v.* environmental considerations.

*vi.* social, cultural and ethical factors.

5.2a Understand that most products consist of multiple materials and that design engineers are required to discriminate between them appropriately for their use, including:

*i.* Ferrous, non-ferrous and alloy metals, such as: 

• mild steel, aluminium and brass.

*ii.* Thermo softening and thermosetting polymers, such as: 

• HIPS, ABS and polyester resin, epoxy resin and polyimides.
 
*iii.* Timbers and manufactured boards, such as:

• oak, plywood and MDF.

*iv.* Textiles used for reinforcement and coverings, such as: 

• geotextiles used in civil engineering and construction.

*v.* composite materials, such as:

• fibre-reinforced plastics, glass-reinforced plastics (GRP) and carbon fibre (CFRP).

*vi.* Smart materials, such as:

• shape memory alloy, motion control gel, self-healing materials, thermochromic, photochromic and electrochromic materials.

*vii.* Modern materials, such as:

• sandwich panels, e-textiles, rare earth magnets, high performance alloys and super-alloys, graphene and carbon nanotubes.

5.3a Understand the characteristics and properties of materials that are significant in Design Engineering, such as:

• density, tensile strength, strength to weight ratio, hardness, durability, thermal and electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, stiffness, elasticity, plasticity, impact resistance, malleability and ductility, machinability.

5.3b Understand how the available forms, costs and properties of materials contribute to the decisions about suitability of materials when developing and manufacturing their own products.
