<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
1.1 What can be learnt by exploring contexts that design solutions are intended for?
a.   Understand that all design practice is context dependent and that investigations 
are required to identify what makes a context distinct in relation to: 
    i.  environment and surroundings
    ii.  user requirements
    iii.  economic and market considerations 
    iv.  product opportunities.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3 learn">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Environment and surroundings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
1.1a.i. Environment and surroundings
Products are designed for use in different environments. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A robot that welds car body panels together will be used exclusively in a factory. 
</li>
<li>A photocopier might be designed for use in a School or office. 
</li>
<li>A plug-in air freshener would be typically used in the home.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When engineers and designers work to create new items, the context for where it is to be used will heavily influence the form of the finished product. A product that is to be used in an industrial environment (like a labelling machine) will be designed solely to perform the task it exists to do, in a safe way. If it has a human operator, any interface (e.g. display, buttons, etc) are large, clear and is intuitive to use as far as possible. Durability will heavily influence the design, as the product may be mission-critical and could cause production to slow or halt in the event of its failure. Industrial products will likely be engineered to make replacing defective parts as convenient as possible (e.g. through the addition of removable access panels). 
</p>

<p>
A product for an office must be designed to both serve its purpose, but to also give a look and feel in keeping with a professional environment. A common colour scheme is grey and silver, objects often have an ‘industrial’ look and ergonomics should be carefully considered to ensure that products are comfortable to use for extended periods. Microsoft produce an ergonomic keyboard, for example. 
</p>

<p>
Products designed for a home environment will commonly be more heavily influenced by the cosmetic finish of the product. For luxury goods, the materials used to finish the product will be of a higher quality, and may include varnished wood and premium plastics (like those seen in coffee machines). As young children are often present in home settings, safety considerations must include making sure that small fingers can’t make their way into areas that cause harm (e.g. think about how plug sockets are designed). 
</p>

<p>
For all products, <b><b>safety must be the prime consideration</b></b>, ensuring that there are no sharp edges, exposed wires or moving parts that could trap a body-part and cause injury.   
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3 try">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">User Requirements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
When a client approaches an engineering team to solve a problem, they will have a list of specific requirements which will need to be satisfied. This list is developed with the engineering team and is called a Design Specification. This may cover areas such as: Aesthetics, size, weight, materials, cost, durability, functionality (i.e. what it actually does), performance (how fast/accurately it does it) and power (e.g. batteries, solar, generator and mains AC). Once the product prototype has been built, the engineering team can test the product against the specification to demonstrate that they have designed a product or system which does exactly what the client asked for. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3 learn">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Economic and Market Considerations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All clients have a budget. At the outset of a new project, they will advise on what their development budget (how much they want to spend on manpower + prototypes to develop a mass-producible product) is, and will indicate the budget for building the actual new product (e.g. Should cost no more than £3 to manufacture per unit). 
</li>
<li>The market that the product is to be aimed at will influence this heavily; a water purification unit for refugees in a third-world country would need to be built as cheaply as possible (to maximise the number of people who can have one), while ensuring that the product works consistently and safely. Any unnecessary flourishes (e.g. branding, nice-to-have features like an LED indicator) would need to be stripped away to the bare minimum amount of hardware to produce the desired result. 
</li>
<li>The market for a new top-spec iPhone would be very different, and to ensure that the client feels they’re receiving value for money, the quality of the product would need to be of the highest standard available in order to justify the price tag that such an item could be expected to command.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-1-4">Product Opportunities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Events happen around the World daily. These can often represent opportunities for entrepreneurs. Some are short-term (e.g. fidget spinners becoming cool) and others may be longer-term (e.g. combating global warming), necessitating new products to solve new problems. By looking for trends and following global events, designers and engineers can identify new, unsolved problems and create successful products to tackle them.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
1.2 What can be learnt by undertaking stakeholder analysis?
a.   Demonstrate an understanding of methods used for investigating stakeholder 
requirements, such as:
•  user-centred design and stakeholder analysis
•  SWOT analysis
•  focus groups 
•  qualitative observations 
•  market research to identify gaps for new products or opportunities to update existing products.

<h3 id="sec-2-1">User Centred Stakeholder Analysis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When a new product is to be designed and built, in order for it to be successful, the target audience must be carefully considered. The different people/groups involved in a product are called stakeholders. In a School, stakeholders include students, teachers, support staff and governors.
</li>
<li>For a piece of industrial manufacturing equipment like a robot that places toppings on frozen pizzas in a factory, stakeholders can include managers, machine operatives, maintenance engineers and system programmers. Each of these people will have particular wants in terms of what the machine might do. 
</li>
<li>The manager will likely want the robot to keep track of how many pizzas it tops each day, how much product falls off the pizza onto the floor (waste), how often it breaks down (costing the company money). 
</li>
<li>The maintenance engineers will want to ensure that all the main parts can be removed in as short a time as possible, that they’re easy to reach and that the reliability of the machine is such that it seldom breaks down.
</li>
<li>The operative (where one is required) will want a machine which requires minimal human input to work, is comfortable to use, reduces the amount of repeated body movement to operate and is safe to use.
</li>
<li><b><b>Practice task: Make a stakeholder list for a new vacuum cleaner and suggest some stakeholder priorities that they might raise.</b></b>

<h3 id="sec-2-2">A SWOT Analysis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
<img src="./img/SWOT_analysis.png" alt="SWOT_analysis.png" />
A SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) is a process developed in the 60’s by which as many considerations as possible are recorded under each of the SWOT headings. For a new smartphone, one might identify:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Strength: The new design is ultra light-weight.
</li>
<li>Weakness: The software is the same as available on every other Android phone
</li>
<li>Opportunities: Has a unique new chip that can be marketed to unlock users doors at homes
</li>
<li>Threats: There are many other phone manufacturers who could release this feature first.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-2-3">Focus Groups</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Focus groups are meetings in which the engineering team meet with different stakeholders to discuss the new product. They may produce a SWOT analysis collaboratively as part of this.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3 learn">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">Qualitative Observation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Qualitative observation is the process of design engineers watching a pre-existing system operating in a live environment (e.g. a factory in which frozen pizzas are manually topped). By watching the process, engineers can fully understand the steps in the existing system and consider different solutions to improve the current system. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-2-5">Market Research</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Market research is the process of looking online (or through product catalogues) at other ways in which the problem can be solved using products designed by other companies. Unless it can be made more cheaply, there is little point in releasing a product which another supplier is already selling. Equally, if an existing product has reviews stating that it lacks a particular feature, the opportunity to release a rival product to compete with it might arise.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
1.2 What can be learnt by undertaking stakeholder analysis?
b.   Demonstrate an understanding of how enterprise can help drive the development of new product ideas through routes to innovation such as:
•  entrepreneurship
•  commercial partnerships
•  venture capitalists and crowd funding websites.

</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">Entrepreneurship</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In order to develop, release and market a new product, substantial initial financial capital will be required. One might fund these through a number of different routes:
</li>
<li>An entrepreneur who has a high level of self-belief in her product might elect to borrow their start-up capital from a bank in the form of a large loan. As the bank will be taking a considerable risk (i.e. if your product doesn’t take off, they’ll lose their money), they would typically expect that you would demonstrate your commitment by sharing the risk. This usually comes by you putting up your own money (if you have enough) or your home against the loan, so that if your business fails, your house can be sold to allow the bank to recover their money. The advantage of this approach is that if you are able to launch a new product, you’ll be able to enjoy all the profits after you’ve paid back your debt. The disadvantage of this is that should your idea not be a success, you risk losing your home and any other assets you may have.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3 try">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">Commercial Partnerships</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some engineers might seek funding through startup-incubators (similar to the TV show, Dragons’ Den). By ‘pitching’ your idea and presenting your business plan to a panel of experienced investors, you may be able to negotiate to obtain the funding you need in exchange for a (often considerable) percentage of your profits if/when your product takes off. Incubators are often able to supply experienced business people to offer advice as well as providing office space for start-ups. 
</li>

<li>Venture Capitalists (VCs) are similar to a start-up incubator. 
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital</a>
</li>
<li>A 21st century approach to raising capital is through the use of crowd-funding, made popular through sites such as www.Kickstarter.com. Crowd funding works by the engineer creating a web page outlining the details of the product they intend to design and create, and allowing prospective

<li>investors to pay for different ‘rewards’, typically at considerably lower prices than the retail price of the product once launched to the general public. If the designer is able to reach a certain level of funding, the website transfers them the money pledged by the individual investors and they are then able to create and launch their product. If they don’t reach the intended funding level, the investors’ money is returned. This has the advantage of not requiring any up-front investment by the engineer and doesn’t expose the investor to as much risk. The disadvantage is that one may not reach their funding target, and that the inventor may not actually be able to deliver the product they’ve promised with the funding they raise if their calculations are incorrect.
