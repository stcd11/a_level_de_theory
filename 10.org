** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 
* Ensuring Health and Safety when working with materials in a workshop

9.1a Demonstrate an understanding of safe working practices in the workshop situation, including:

*i.* understanding the need for risk assessments.

As part of managing the health and safety of your project you must control the risks in your clasrrom environment. To do this you need to think about what might cause harm to you and the people around you and decide whether you are taking reasonable steps to prevent that harm. This is known as risk assessment.
[[./img/risk_assessment.jpg]]

*ii.* identifying hazards and implementing control measures to minimise risks.

One of the most important aspects of your risk assessment is accurately identifying the potential hazards in the classroom. A good starting point is to walk around your classroom and think about any hazards. In other words, what is it about the activities, processes or substances used that could injure yourself or other students or harm their health?

9.1b Demonstrate an understanding of how to work safely with specialist tools, techniques, processes, equipment and machinery during the design and manufacture of products. 

When designing and making your project, you will need to demonstrate you have considered in advance what all the risks are and what you plan to do to minimise the risks.

Once you have considered all the steps and written down what you plan to do, you will then need to do the activity, showing and explaining how you went about implementing all of the H&S strategies.

These can be in the form of photographs or explanations, but you will need to do this for every activity or step.

* Implications of health and safety legislation on product manufacture

9.2a Demonstrate an understanding of how the regulatory and legislative framework in the health and safety at work act (HASAW) sets out duties of employers and employees in the product manufacturing industries.including:

*i.* Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH).

COSHH stands for 'Control of Substances Hazardous to Health' and under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002, employers need to either prevent or reduce their workers' exposure to substances that are hazardous to their health.

*ii.* Personal Protective Equipment at work regulations (PPE).

PPE is equipment that will protect the user against health or safety risks at work. It can include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses

*iii.* Ensuring machinery is well maintained.

In order to ensure work equipment does not deteriorate to the extent that it may put people at risk, employers, the relevant self-employed and others in control of work equipment are required by PUWER to keep it 'maintained in an efficient state, in efficient order and in good repair'. If the manufacturer is self-employed and their work poses no risk to the health and safety of others, then health and safety law may not apply to them.  HSE has guidance to help manufacturers understand if the law applies. Such effective maintenance can not only help in meeting PUWER requirements but can also serve other business objectives, such as improved productivity and reduced environmental impact.

The frequency and nature of maintenance should be determined through risk assessment, taking full account of:

- the manufacturer's recommendations
- the intensity of use
- operating environment (eg the effect of temperature, corrosion, weathering)
- user knowledge and experience
- the risk to health and safety from any foreseeable failure or malfunction 

Safety-critical parts of work equipment may need a higher and more frequent level of attention than other aspects, which can be reflected within any maintenance programme. Breakdown maintenance, undertaken only after faults or failures have occurred, will not be suitable where significant risk will arise from the continued use of the work equipment.

9.2b The responsibility of manufacturers to appropriately label products and offer guarentees to their consumers to deliver the correct levels of product assurance related to safety.

Product labeling is covered under the Trade Description Act. Labels must include accurate information to ensure that products can be used safely and correctly.
